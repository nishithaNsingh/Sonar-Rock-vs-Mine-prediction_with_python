# Sonar-Rock-vs-Mine-prediction_with_python


## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether sonar signals correspond to a rock or a mine. The dataset used in this project contains sonar signals recorded from different underwater objects, making it suitable for classification tasks.

## Contents

- **Data Preprocessing**: Steps to load and preprocess the dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and analyses to understand the data better.
- **Model Training**: Implementation of various machine learning algorithms to classify sonar signals.
- **Model Evaluation**: Techniques to evaluate model performance and select the best model.
- **Conclusion**: Summary of findings and future work.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the SONAR dataset, which can be obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It consists of sonar signals represented as features, with labels indicating whether the signal corresponds to a rock or a mine.
